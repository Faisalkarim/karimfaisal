Hello! I am Md Faisal Karim, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from [RUET, Bangladesh](https://www.ruet.ac.bd/). Currently exploring opportunities in graduate studies (Ph.D./M.S).

At present, I am doing a remote **research internship** at [Superintelligence Lab, UESTC, China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Chaoning Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaoning-zhang-7b277699/). Alongside, I am working remotely as a **Research Assistant** with **QU-MLG** team, supervised by [Prof. Muhammed E.H. Chowdhury](https://sites.google.com/view/mchowdhury).

My primary research focus lies in **AI in Healthcare, Medical Image Analysis, and Image Generation**. In my current RA duty, I work extensively on these areas. Recently, I also started exploring **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** and **Semantic Communication (SemCom)** as part of my internship.

I am very enthusiastic about research and deeply motivated to solve challenging problems passionately. My long-term goal is to become a **Research Scientist** ‚Äî something I am truly obsessed with. I always follow a constructive path toward my goals and make sure to learn from every mistake along the way.
My motto is: "One pixel at a time!"

Beyond academia, I am a huge football fan and a proud supporter of Real Madrid. I also enjoy exploring new places (though I haven‚Äôt had the chance to travel much yet ‚Äî but one day, I‚Äôll conquer the world üåç). I am a foodie at heart, i enjoy trying different cuisines.
