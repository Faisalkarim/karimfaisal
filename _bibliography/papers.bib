  abstract={This ongoing research focuses on developing methods to streamline motion artefact correction in brain MRI images. Motion artefacts often degrade image quality, limiting accurate diagnosis and analysis. To address this, I am exploring advanced approaches such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and contrastive learning to improve image fidelity and reliability for both clinical and research applications.},

  abstract={Pneumonia and COVID-19 rank among the most severe and prevalent respiratory diseases of our time. Recently, there has been a resurgence in cases, with patients often testing negative for one condition while being positive for the other, creating challenges in accurate diagnosis. However, limited research has been conducted for joint diagnosis. This research presents a highly efficient and lightweight Convolutional Neural Network, named SF-CXRnet, meticulously designed with minimal parameters to enhance computational efficiency, offering an effective method for identifying COVID-19 and pneumonia cases through chest X-ray images. Additionally, The proposed model effectively classifies lung X-rays into three categories: Normal, COVID-19, and Pneumonia, offering a powerful tool for accurate diagnosis. In this study, the proposed model crafted and trained using the COVID-19 radiography dataset offered remarkable outcomes. Despite utilizing just 1.54 million parameters, the proposed SF-CXRnet model achieved an outstanding 98.21% test accuracy, outperforming pre-trained models like VGG-19, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2. Prioritizing disease detection, SF-CXRnet demonstrates exceptional performance with a 98% recall across all three classes, surpassing other models used in this research. This proposed model’s remarkable accuracy in distinguishing COVID-19 from pneumonia, along with its highest recall score compared to state-of-the-art, underscores its potential to enable timely medical interventions. The study advances COVID-19 and Pneumonia detection, paving the way for enhanced automated solutions, ultimately improving accessibility and precision in lung disease diagnosis.},

  abstract={Brain Tumors (BTs), characterized by the abnormal proliferation of cells, cause significant damage to vital blood vessels and nerves in the body. Misdiagnosis can result in inappropriate medical interventions, reducing patient survival rates. Therefore, accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for improving outcomes. This study explores an integrated approach combining deep learning (DL) and traditional machine learning (ML) techniques for BT detection and classification. While conventional ML methods require labor-intensive handcrafted features, DL offers robust automatic feature extraction, gaining prominence in classification tasks. In this study, various experiments were conducted, integrating ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, and a Custom CNN (CCNN) with support vector machines (SVM) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) for tumor classification. The combination of DL and ML involved feature extraction using ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, and CCNN, followed by classification with SoftMax, SVM, and KNN. The Brain Tumor MRI dataset, containing 3,264 images across three tumor types and one normal class, was used for this research. MRI images were enhanced using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to improve feature quality. All proposed methods showed strong performance, with the hybrid SFTNet (CCNN+SVM) model achieving an impressive 97% accuracy and a 97% recall across the tumor classes, alongside a near-perfect 99% for the normal class.},

  abstract={Glaucoma, a major contributor to irreversible blind-ness, which requires early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In this work, we use deep learning techniques to automate the diagnosis of glaucoma from retinal fundus images. For increased efficiency, we use a cropped fundus images instead of analyzing entire fundus photos. We use VGG-19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet B3 for binary classification on the ACRIMA dataset. Notably, ResNet-50 achieves 100% accuracy. Next, we combine glaucoma suspect samples from publicly accessible datasets with ACRIMA and DRISHTI-GS1 to create “Glaucoma suspect” class in a custom multiclass dataset. Using this dataset, EfficientNet-B3 and ResNet-50 produce 97% and 98% accuracy rates, respectively. Both models perform flawlessly when it comes to categorizing the suspect class & negative class with 100% sensitivity. Our results highlight the effectiveness of deep learning in glaucoma detection and provide interesting directions for enhancing diagnostic precision and facilitating early intervention.},
